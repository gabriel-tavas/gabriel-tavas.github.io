### - Term 1 -[]()

*October to December 2022*

-   [Design tools 1]() . Explored various digital tools
-   [Systems design studio 1]() . Started planning for a River Lab concept through the framework of the Fab City fullstack
-   [Distributed design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qM2mBoawyw1bZ9zepnmwE8eHLlTyj2S9R-tZgKPIIf4/edit?usp=drive_link) . Studied distributed design and wrote an article categorizing projects into three levels
-   [Propagating collaboration](https://wikifactory.com/@gabetavas/modular-dog-house) . Designed an open-source dog house and sought collaborators for the project
-   [Bio-based economies]() . Made a flax-agar utensil prototype as part of a group project

### - Term 2 -[]()

*January to March 2023*

-   [Design tools 2]() . Explored various hard-tech tools
-   [Systems design studio 2](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/ef65351b858442eca7af67aaf665ab51) . Planning for a River Lab concept
-   [Distributed economies](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ztcXg5qoDe6Mzb5DIpkQqhBkZCC4KZAE?usp=share_link) . Envisioned a cryptocurrency that is valued based on a river's ecological health
-   [Activating communities]() . A biweekly class covering general community engagement strategies
-   [Human Bio-Interactions]() . A fascinating workshop on environmental analysis, which involved extracting DNA from organisms living in river bank soil.
-   [Bio-Design]() . A workshop that involved tinkering with various biomaterials, including natural dyes and minerals.

### - Term 3 -[]()

*March 2023 to June 2023*

-   [Holistic Technologies](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMRk6Hjs=/) . Heard various case studies of technology applications and presented two low-tech case studies, wood-powered vehicles and air compression storage.
-   [Systems design studio 3](http://gabetavas.tilda.ws/wetlands) . Consolidated my early ideation for the River Lab. I ended up pitching the idea of biobased wetlands, with mycelium serving as a platform for floating plants and mussels held within willow baskets so that they can filter river water.
-   [Social, economical, and environmental impact evaluation](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMSSfHu8=/) . Developed a theory of change, problem tree, solution tree, logical framework, and data collection plan for my final project.
-   [Design and Biotechnology](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ExtryB5AjklswzHFLQI4o6WwN-2vkf6yOK5-Qjsf0UI/edit?usp=sharing) . Workshop that built up my final project and my knowledge of fermentation
-   [Bioregions Matter](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMPC2NbI=/) . Closely studied the bioregion of Chicago in relation to my final project. Found willow tree populations.
-   [Distributed Leadership]() . Ronald Sistek led a relaxed workshop in which I offered feedback for another classmate's project.
