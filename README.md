### - Term 3 -[]()

*March 2023 to June 2023*

-   [Holistic Technologies](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMRk6Hjs=/) . Heard various case studies of technology applications and presented two low-tech case studies, wood-powered vehicles and air compression storage.
-   [Systems design studio 3](http://gabetavas.tilda.ws/wetlands) . Consolidated my early ideation for the River Lab. I ended up pitching the idea of biobased wetlands, with mycelium serving as a platform for floating plants and mussels held within willow baskets so that they can filter river water.
-   [Social, economical, and environmental impact evaluation](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMSSfHu8=/) . Developed a theory of change, problem tree, solution tree, logical framework, and data collection plan for my final project.
-   [Design and Biotechnology](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ExtryB5AjklswzHFLQI4o6WwN-2vkf6yOK5-Qjsf0UI/edit?usp=sharing) . Workshop that built up my final project and my knowledge of fermentation
-   [Bioregions Matter](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMPC2NbI=/) . Closely studied the bioregion of Chicago in relation to my final project. Found willow tree populations.
-   [Distributed Leadership]() . Ronald Sistek led a relaxed workshop in which I offered feedback for another classmate's project.
